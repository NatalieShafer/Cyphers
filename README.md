# Cyphers

This application encrypts and decrypts three simple cyphers. There are two monoalphabetic cyphers; the Caeser cypher which is a simple shift in characters, and the Standard Pigpen Cypher which is a set of symbols to replace the charatcers. It also contains Morse code which is a simple substitution cypher.
